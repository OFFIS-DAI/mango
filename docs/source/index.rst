Welcome to mango's documentation!
=================================
*mango* (modular python agent framework) is a python library for *multi-agent systems (MAS)*. It is written on top of `asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ and is releassed under the MIT license.

*mango* allows the user to create simple agents with little effort and in the same
time offers options to structure agents with complex behaviour.
The main features of mango are listed below.

Features
=================================
- Container mechanism to speedup local message exchange
- Message definition based on the FIPA ACL standard
- Structuring complex agents with loose coupling and agent roles
- Built-in codecs: `JSON <https://www.json.org>`_ and `protobuf <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers>`_
- Supports communication between agents directly via TCP or via an external MQTT broker in the middle
